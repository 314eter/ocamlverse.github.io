# Best Practices

Here is a collection of best practices for successful programming in OCaml.
You should be using **ocp-indent** (see below) for your code formatting.

## Code Layout Tooling
* [ocp-indent](https://github.com/OCamlPro/ocp-indent) is an OCaml package that aligns your code in a canonical manner. This is considered *the* standard for OCaml code structure and indentation, and should generally always be used for your code. You can integrate ocp-indent with your editor to automatically indent your code the canonical OCaml way as you type. With ocp-indent, many of the issues that are covered by the style guides below become irrelevant.
