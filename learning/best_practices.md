# Best Practices

Here is a collection of best practices for successful programming in OCaml.

* [OCaml programming guidelines at ocaml.org](http://www.ocaml.org/learn/tutorials/guidelines.html)
* [XEN â€“ OCaml Best Practices for Developers](http://wiki.xen.org/wiki/OCaml_Best_Practices_for_Developers) 
* [Jane Street Style](https://opensource.janestreet.com/standards/)

These three guides are very similar.  Some people have found them useful, but be aware that some of the code examples are not valid OCaml:

* [CIS500 Programming Style](https://www.seas.upenn.edu/~cis500/cis500-f06/resources/programming_style.html) 
* [UPenn Code Style](https://www.seas.upenn.edu/~cis120/current/programming_style.shtml)
