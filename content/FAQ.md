* What is a "toplevel"?

A/the "toplevel" is an OCaml term for a program that provides a prompt
at which you can enter OCaml expressions and see what happens when they
are evaluated.  In some languages this is known as a "REPL"--a
Read-Eval-Print loop. It Reads what you enter, Evaluates it, and
then Prints the result.  Many people who use an OCaml toplevel use `utop`,
which is more convenient and full-featured than `ocaml`.  You can also evaluate 
OCaml expressions in an editor or IDE, for example.  See the
