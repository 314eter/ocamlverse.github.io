* What is a "toplevel"?

  A/the "toplevel" is an OCaml term for a program that provides a prompt
  at which you can enter OCaml expressions and see what happens when they
  are evaluated.  In some languages this is known as a "REPL", a
  Read-Eval-Print loop. (It Reads what you enter, Evaluates it, and
  then Prints the result.)  Many people who use an OCaml toplevel use the
  `utop` toplevel.  It's more full-featured than the `ocaml` toplevel that
  comes with an OCaml compiler. You can also evaluate OCaml expressions in an
  editor or IDE, for example.  See the 
  [Code tools](https://github.com/OCamlverse/ocamlverse.github.io/blob/master/content/code_tools.md)
  page.
