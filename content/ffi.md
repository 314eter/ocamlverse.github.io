# Foreign Function Interface

Interop with C is the most natural for OCaml, since the runtime is partially written in C.

## C

* [Ctypes](https://github.com/ocamllabs/ocaml-ctypes) – Library for binding to C libraries using pure OCaml.
* [ocaml-main-program-in-c](https://github.com/johnwhitington/ocaml-main-program-in-c) – Example build system for making mixed C/Ocaml binaries where the main program is in C.

## Python

* [Py](https://github.com/zshipko/ocaml-py): Library for interacting with Python 3.5 using Ctypes.
* [Pyml](https://github.com/thierry-martinez/pyml): Library for interacting with python. Uses C stubs.
* [lymp](https://github.com/dbousque/lymp): Another library for interacting with Python, this one using a Python process.
