# Design Principles For Stdlib 2.0

## Data Structures

* To maintain compatibility with previous versions of the stdlib, we will, in all likelihood,
need to keep datastructure types identical.

## Hypothetical Module List

This is a hypothetical list of modules that would be included in the V2 stdlib:

### Data Structures

* List
* Array
* BigArray
* String
* BigString
* Map
* Hashtbl
* Hashtrie?

### Data Types

* Int/32/64
* Float
* Bool
* Option
* Result

### File System

* File
