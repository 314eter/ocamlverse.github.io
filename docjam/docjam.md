The May 2018 OCaml DocJam is a distributed/remote event happening on
May 18, 19, 20, encouraging interested members of the OCaml community
to collectively improve the documentation of OCaml programs and
libraries by proposing improvements to the documentation of OCaml
projects.

## OCamlverse Rules for the DocJam

1. Feel free to request commit privileges for OCamlverse by asking in an
   issue ticket. (This is always true!)
2. You may place any Work in Progress documentation you like in the
   `docjam` directory (or a subdirectory of it), and you may link to it
   in this document.
3. You do not need to make a pull request to edit anything you are
   working on in `docjam` during the DocJam.
4. Please put your name and github handle near the top of any document
   you are writing so people will know who is working on the
   document. If you want to commit to someone else's work in progress,
   _ask them if it's okay_.
5. If something is far enough along to be worth asking other people to
   look at, link to it at the bottom of this page. You can edit this
   file at will to add such links.
6. If you are done with something and want to make a Pull Request to
   move it elsewhere in OCamlverse, you should obviously feel free.

After the DocJam is over, we will move some of the contents to
appropriate parts of OCamlverse, clean out some things, and we may
create a permanent scratch directory for Work in Progress.

## Useful Tools for the DocJam

* [grip](https://github.com/joeyespo/grip): a python tool that
  renders GitHub Flavored Markdown, including GitHub's own
  CSS. Really handy for previsualizing your markdown pages!
  Includes a small web server and refreshes the page in your
  browser whenever you change the corresponding .md file.
