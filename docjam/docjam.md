The May 2018 OCaml DocJam is a distributed/remote event happening on
May 18, 19, 20, encouraging interested members of the OCaml community
to collectively improve the documentation of OCaml programs and
libraries by proposing improvements to the documentation of OCaml
projects.

OCamlverse members should feel free to place Work In Progress
documentation in the DocJam directory and link to it from this page
without performing a Pull Request. If you want to later move the
documentation into place in the main part of OCamlverse, please
request a Pull Request then.
