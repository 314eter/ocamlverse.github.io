# TODO

NOTE: Adding to this page does *not* require a PR. Deleting from this page *does* unless you have
permission from the admins.

* Rather than creating an issue per todo item, which could clog up our issue list,
we have this list of items that anyone can choose to take care of.
* Also, we need a place to suggest ideas as they come up, and people don't always
feel comfortable using issues for that.

## Immediate
* Move [DocJam contributions](/docjam/docjam.md) to their proper places (requires PRs):

## Ideas for content
* Document abstract types, private types (learning).
