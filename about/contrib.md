# Contributing

You want to contribute? Awesome. Here are some important guidelines that *must be read and adhered to*:

## Goals

* The driving motivation for this site is to improve the OCaml community. If you're not interested in that goal, please don't join the site.
* Our goal is to have this be as useful a documentation resource as possible. As as example, we don't just want to list some obscure libraries that aren't used: OPAM can do that too. We want to direct users to the good libraries, give them tips about them, and let the users know if some libraries are deprecated or unmaintained.
* Another example: in terms of the learning category, we want to provide the most useful material to learn up-to-date practices, rather than linking to everything out there despite the quality. That means pruning of old guidelines that aren't relevant anymore. Just because someone wrote content, doesn't mean it deserves to be directed to forever.
* Is there a specific limit to the types of content we envision for this resource? Not really. If you want to have your project documented here, that's fine. If you want to have pages about type theory, that's fine too. Laying out a vision for a new library? Sounds good. Anything in the OCaml universe is fair game as far as we're concerned. Let's just chat about it first in the discussion channels, follow the guidelines, and try to keep the hierarchy sane and logical.

## Discussion channels

* Discussion about this resource happens
  * On [discuss.ocaml.org](https://discuss.ocaml.org) in Ecosystem with the `ocamlverse` tag: long-term vision and direction
  * On [discord in the #ocamlverse channel](https://discord.gg/cCYQbqN): quick, responsive dicussion about issues.
  * In an issue in this repo: ideas for content, missing pieces
  * In a PR: discussions of a particular change

## Tone and attitude

* Contribute to the extent that you know. If you're not confident about a topic, don't write about it, or discuss it first. You can also leave a question in the content itself asking for someone more knowledgable to fill in the gaps.
* Try to be as professional sounding as possible -- not in a pretentious way, just try to be neutral.
* Don't denigrate particular projects or people. Saying a project is unmaintained is fine if it's true -- saying it sucks isn't. Reasonable praise is welcome.
* Accept that people will modify your contribution. This is a living document. If you're too attached to your content as-is, this is the wrong resource to use.
* Expect people to disagree with you. Defer to the experts and to the site managers.
* Accept criticism. Even if your contribution is criticized, you need to be able to accept the criticism, learn and adapt.
* Failing to adhere to these guidelines can get your contribution rights revoked.

## Protocol

* These contribution guidelines **may not be changed** without discussion with the ocamlverse community.
* All changes may be submitted via a PR process. Submit a PR of your change, and another maintainer can merge it.
* *Small changes* are those that concern adding a little bit of content, fixing mistakes, etc. These can be done at will if you're a contributor and can be merged without discussion. It's always nice to drop a note about them though.
* *Medium changes* involve adding quite a bit of content or changing much of it. These should always be discussed first on the discussion channels, and you need to receive agreement with your change.
* *Large changes* such as adding a new section, reorganization, adding new directories etc require using a PR.
* If any contributor voices a serious concern about a change you made/want to make, it becomes elevated to the category of a *large change* and requires a PR. It may be undone first so you can place it in a PR.
* Contributing to this resource is ultimately a privilege. We trust that you have the right intentions and knowledge to contribute. This privilege can be revoked.

## Revoked Contribution Rights

* Failing to adhere to the required tone and attitude, the protocol, showing a lack of respect for the other contributors, or showing a serious lack of good judgement and receptivneness to comments, as determined by the managers of the site, can cause you to have your contributor rights revokes. You can still contribute via PR, but not directly merge content.

## Copying Content

* Only copy material rather than link to it (better yet, do both) if you've been granted permission by the author of said material.
