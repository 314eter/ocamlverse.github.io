# About OCamlverse

OCamlverse is essentially a *modern wiki*, with the advantage that it's based on git and github's resources. Anyone can ask for contribution rights, and like a wiki, small-to-medium changes can be made instantaneously (for larger changes, a PR is required). We therefore get the low-latency advantage of wikis combined with the reliability and history of git.

Ocamlverse's mission is twofold:

1. To provide an easy-to-access, easy-to-update documentation resource about anything important to the OCaml community.
2. To encourage a culture of documentation and contribution in the OCaml community, empowering its growth.

We believe OCaml is at an important crossroads in its history: with the incredible success of ReasonML, we can become a fossil - the ancestor of a wildly popular language - or we can leverage the excitement and interest of the ReasonML community to enlarge and grow the OCaml community as well.

Additionally, we think that feedback loops are extremely powerful in a language community: the more people contribute and the more documentation is added, the more other people will want to contribute.

Join us. Read the [Contibution Guidelines](contrib.md) page, ask to be given contribution rights or submit a PR, and help us make OCamlverse a terrific documentation resource, and the OCaml language an even bigger success.
