# Planning

* I think it's useful to have a planning page to slowly build up ideas.

## Sources of Inspiration

* [hask](http://dev.stephendiehl.com/hask/): could really give us some good ideas about topics to include

## Questions
* OPAM: should we have a page for OPAM including tips and useful commands?
  * Some of it would be duplicating OPAM's own documentation. But should we supplement when we think the documentation is lackluster?
  * For example, the OPAM 1.2 command `eval $(opam config env --switch=SWITCH)` for a shell-based switch is not present in the OPAM docs.
